# Onboarding-as-a-Service (OaaS) Application Architecture

This document outlines a detailed architecture for an Onboarding-as-a-Service (OaaS) application, designed to address common onboarding challenges such as scalability, customization, security, reliability, integrations, data analytics, and user experience.

---

## I. Core Principles & Design Considerations

* **Multi-tenancy:** Each company operates as an independent tenant with logically separated data.
* **Modularity & Microservices:** The application is broken down into small, independently deployable services.
* **Event-Driven Architecture:** Asynchronous communication between services using message queues enhances responsiveness and resilience.
* **API-First Approach:** All functionalities are exposed via well-defined APIs.
* **Security by Design:** Robust authentication, authorization, and data encryption are paramount.
* **Scalability:** Leverages cloud-native services and containerization for horizontal scaling.
* **Observability:** Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing are implemented for rapid issue resolution.
* **User Experience (UX):** Intuitive interfaces for both company administrators and new hires.

## II. Architecture Components

### A. Front-End Applications

1.  **Company Admin Web Portal (React/Vue/Angular)**
    * **Purpose:** The primary interface for companies to configure their onboarding flows.
    * **Features:** Tenant management, onboarding flow builder (drag-and-drop), stage configuration (text, media, forms, links), theming & branding, custom URL management, new hire tracking, analytics dashboard, integration settings, and notification templates.
    * **Technologies:** React, Vue.js, Angular, state management libraries (Redux/Vuex/Ngrx).

2.  **New Hire Onboarding Portal (React/Vue/Static HTML/Next.js)**
    * **Purpose:** The actual onboarding experience for new hires.
    * **Features:** Dynamic content rendering, interactive forms, resource access, progress tracking, themed UI reflecting company branding, and feedback mechanisms.
    * **Technologies:** React, Vue.js, or server-side rendering frameworks like Next.js/Nuxt.js.

### B. Back-End Services (Microservices Architecture)

1.  **API Gateway (e.g., Nginx, Kong, AWS API Gateway)** (Core)
    * **Purpose:** Single entry point for all requests, handling routing, authentication, authorization, rate limiting, caching, load balancing, and SSL termination.

2.  **User & Identity Service** (Core)
    * **Purpose:** Manages user authentication (company admins, new hires) and authorization.
    * **Features:** User registration, login, password management, role-based access control (RBAC), and token generation.
    * **Data Store:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

3.  **Company & Tenant Service** (Core)
    * **Purpose:** Manages company profiles, subscription plans, and tenant-specific configurations.
    * **Features:** Company CRUD operations, subscription management, billing integration.
    * **Data Store:** PostgreSQL.

4.  **Onboarding Flow Service** (Core)
    * **Purpose:** Core service for defining and managing onboarding flow structures.
    * **Features:** CRUD operations for flows, stages, and their properties (order, type, dependencies).
    * **Data Store:** MongoDB (for flexible schema) or PostgreSQL with JSONB.

5.  **Content Management Service (CMS)** (Core)
    * **Purpose:** Manages the content within each onboarding stage (text, images, videos, forms, external links, embedded code).
    * **Features:** Content creation, versioning, media asset management.
    * **Data Store:** S3-compatible object storage for media, PostgreSQL or MongoDB for metadata.

6.  **New Hire Progress Service** (Core)
    * **Purpose:** Tracks each new hire's progress through their assigned onboarding flow.
    * **Features:** Records stage completion, tracks form submissions, manages deadlines.
    * **Data Store:** PostgreSQL.

7.  **Notification Service** (Core)
    * **Purpose:** Handles all communication (email, SMS, in-app notifications).
    * **Features:** Sending welcome emails, stage completion notifications, reminders, integration with third-party providers.
    * **Technologies:** Message queues for asynchronous processing.

8.  **Integration Service** (Secondary)
    * **Purpose:** Facilitates connections with external HRIS, ATS, identity providers, and e-signature platforms.
    * **Features:** Webhooks, API integrations, data mapping, and transformation.
    * **Technologies:** REST clients, message queues.

9.  **Analytics & Reporting Service** (Secondary)
    * **Purpose:** Collects and processes onboarding data for insights.
    * **Features:** Data aggregation, dashboard generation, custom report creation.
    * **Data Store:** Data Warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery) or analytics database.

10. **Custom URL / Domain Service (Preferrable custom URL)** (Core)
    * **Purpose:** Manages mapping of custom URLs/subdomains to specific onboarding flows.
    * **Features:** Provisioning DNS records (CNAMEs), SSL certificate management.
    * **Technologies:** DNS provider APIs, Certificate management.

### C. Shared Infrastructure & Data Stores

* **Databases:** (Core) PostgreSQL (relational), MongoDB (document), Redis (caching/sessions), Object Storage (S3-compatible for static assets).
* **Message Queue/Broker:** (Core) RabbitMQ, Kafka, AWS SQS/SNS, Azure Service Bus for asynchronous communication.
* **Container Orchestration:** (Secondary) Kubernetes for deploying, managing, and scaling microservices.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** (Secondary) Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps for automated deployment.
* **Monitoring & Logging Tools:** (Secondary) Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog for observability.

## III. Addressing Onboarding Challenges

This architecture directly addresses core challenges:

* **Customization:** Flexible flow and content services, intuitive admin portal.
* **Custom URLs:** Dedicated service for DNS and SSL management.
* **Scalability:** Microservices, containerization, cloud-native databases.
* **Security:** API Gateway, User & Identity Service, data encryption, tenant isolation.
* **Integrations:** Dedicated Integration Service with webhooks and API clients.
* **Reporting & Analytics:** Dedicated Analytics Service for data insights.
* **Maintainability & Development Speed:** Microservices enable independent team development.
* **Reliability:** Redundancy via orchestration, asynchronous processing.
* **Personalization:** Flow and New Hire Progress Services track individual journeys.

## IV. New Hire Onboarding Process

1.  **Company Admin** creates/configures an onboarding flow via the **Company Admin Web Portal**.
2.  The **Company Admin Web Portal** sends API requests to the **Onboarding Flow Service** and **Content Service** to store flow definition and content.
3.  The **Company Admin** assigns a new hire to a flow, interacting with the **New Hire Progress Service**.
4.  The **Notification Service** sends a welcome email to the new hire (triggered by the **New Hire Progress Service**).
5.  The **New Hire** clicks the custom URL (e.g., `onboarding.mycompany.com`) in the welcome email.
6.  The **API Gateway** (via **Custom URL Service**) routes the request to the **New Hire Onboarding Portal**.
7.  The **New Hire Onboarding Portal** fetches the relevant flow and content from the respective services.
8.  As the new hire completes stages, the **New Hire Onboarding Portal** updates their progress via the **New Hire Progress Service**.
9.  The **Analytics Service** consumes events from the **New Hire Progress Service** for reporting.
10. If configured, the **Integration Service** triggers webhooks or API calls to external systems upon specific events.

## V. Resuming Onboarding Without Logging In

To allow users to resume onboarding without explicit login:

1.  **Session Token/ID:** The onboarding link includes a unique, temporary, and long-lived **session ID or token** as a URL parameter (e.g., `onboarding.company.com/flow/xyz123?session=ABCDEFG`) or stored as a **secure HTTP-only cookie** upon first access.
2.  **Backend Session Management:** The **New Hire Progress Service** associates this session ID with the specific new hire and their progress, storing the current stage, completed steps, and submitted data.
3.  **Resuming Flow:** When the user revisits the URL, the **API Gateway** identifies the session ID (from URL or cookie). The **New Hire Onboarding Portal** queries the **New Hire Progress Service** using this ID to retrieve the user's last saved state and resumes the onboarding from that point.

**Security and UX considerations:** Token expiration, optional IP/device fingerprinting for added security, and clear communication to the user that their progress is saved. Highly sensitive steps might require a temporary, one-time verification.
